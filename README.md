# todo_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

**Overview**


**Purpose:** A feature-rich to-do application designed to manage tasks efficiently with capabilities for task prioritization, notifications, and a dynamic search feature.


**MVC Architecture:** Utilized to separate concerns and maintain a clean codebase:
**Models:** Define the structure of data and business logic.

**Views (UI):** Handle the presentation of data and user interactions.

**Controllers:** Manage the flow of data between models and views.

**State Management:** Utilized GetX for efficient state management, ensuring smooth UI updates and consistent state handling across the application.

**Database Management:** Implemented sqflite for robust local database operations, including task insertion, querying, updating, and deletion.

**Local Notifications:** Integrated local notifications to remind users about upcoming or overdue tasks, enhancing task management and user engagement.

**Development Approach**

**Task-Based Design:** Focused on creating a user-centric to-do application where tasks are managed, edited, and notified effectively.

**Modular Widget Architecture:** Refactored and organized widgets for clarity and reusability, including separate files for individual functionalities (e.g., task_tile.dart, add_task_bar_page.dart).

**Prioritization Feature:** Incorporated a priority field to allow users to categorize tasks based on importance, seamlessly integrated into both the UI and database.

**Search Functionality:** Implemented a search feature to quickly locate tasks based on keywords, enhancing user experience and task accessibility.

**Error Handling:** Addressed and resolved errors related to notifications and database operations to ensure a stable and reliable application experience.
